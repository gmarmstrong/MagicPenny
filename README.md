# MagicPenny

MagicPenny is a Minecraft mod that adds an item called "love" to the game.
When held in the player's inventory, love will lose durability and eventually break.
If the player drops love from their inventory, and another player picks it up, both players will receive it in their inventory fully repaired.

## Inspiration

```plain
Love is something if you give it away,
Give it away, give it away.
Love is something if you give it away,
You end up having more.

It's just like a magic penny,
Hold it tight and you won't have any.
Lend it, spend it, and you'll have so many
They'll roll all over the floor.

[...]
